The robot will be controlled by means of an evolutionary algorithm/artificial neural network control system which will be running on a Raspberry Pi. It will work in tangent with a number of Arduino's and Arduino control/capability modules to facilitate actual hardware actions. Vision code will be programmed using OpenCV and will run on an old desktop. Actual robot (hardware) is being assembled from a mixture of fabricated components (such as an enclosure) as well as individual manufactured components (such as motors). The main focus of this project is the various artificial intelligence programs working together to allow for the robot to learn behaviors, identify targets, strategize, and make real-time decisions to engage a user in a game of pool. Communications protocols/tools will be disclosed in the near future.
